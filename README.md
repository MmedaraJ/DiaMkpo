# DiaMkpo
This ia an android project. 
It models an app for a single restaurant called Dia Mkpo. 
I designed the UI myself. 
There are two logins - customer (Google sign in) and staff (Email and password sign in). 
A customer can perform the regular customer activities (search, checkout, menu, view past orders, etc). 
A staff can search for a meal and edit it, add a new meal or delete a meal.
I am using google firestore database and MVVM design pattern.
